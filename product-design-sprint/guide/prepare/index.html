	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>
	In order to run a successful sprint, it’s important to do some upfront
	preparation. Whether you’re running the sprint for your own organization
	or for a client, it’s important to prepare with the following:
	</p>
	<div class="separator"></div>
	<h2>Set roles for the sprint</h2>
	<p>
	<strong>Facilitator:</strong> Leads the design sprint. Guides the
	sprint from start to completion.
	</p>
	<p>
	<strong>Recorder:</strong> Takes notes, photographs and is in charge
	of the documentation for the sprint.
	</p>
	<p><strong>Product Owner:</strong> Typically the client and the person</p>
	with the initial product vision. This person has final say in the product.
	<div class="separator"></div>
	<h2>Define Expectations</h2>
	<p>
	Sometimes, design sprints converge on solutions that are partially or
	completely invalidated. Some things will have worked, and others won't.
	Make sure everyone understands that the outcome falls in one of three
	buckets:
	</p>
	<p><strong>Most stuff worked</strong></p>
	<p>
	This often doesn't happen during the first sprint on a project, but if
	it happens to you, everyone on the team is probably on the same page
	about the fixes and tweaks you need to make. What to do next: Take a
	week to tune your existing prototype. Create a backlog for developers
	to start implementation of the most important features or API
	integrations.
	</p>
	<p><strong>Some big questions</strong></p>
	<p>
	A common outcome after a user study is a mixed bag: a few hits, a few
	tweaks, and a couple of real head-scratchers. Fortunately Keynote
	prototypes are easy to change, and as long as some parts of your design
	are solid, you can probably build on what you have. What to do next:
	You can move fast on the tweaks, but you’ll want to come up with
	multiple solutions for the bigger problems. Start your next sprint at
	step 2 (diverge).
	</p>
	<p><strong>Everything exploded</strong></p>
	<p>
	We've seen a lot of designs go up in flames, and that's OK. You learned
	that something didn’t work, and it only took you a few hours to build
	it. This is great progress, and very cheap relative to building and
	launching a full product. Think what would have happened if you’d spent
	weeks or months implementing this solution! What to do next: Start your
	next sprint back at the drawing board with step 1 (understand). (Hint:
	the results of this study are perfect fodder for reviewing and building
	understanding as a group.)
	</p>
	<div class="separator"></div>
	<h2>Capture existing competition</h2>
	<p>
	Any potential competition that solves the same or similar problem that
	the sprint is trying to solve. This should include lowest common
	denominator competitors such as email and offline tools. Typically done
	by the Product Owner.
	</p>
	<div class="separator"></div>
	<h2>Set up room</h2>
	<p>
	Make sure you have a room big enough to fit all of the people in the
	sprint. The room would have a whiteboard and a place to pin or tape up
	sketches. <strong>Typically done by Facilitator.</strong>
