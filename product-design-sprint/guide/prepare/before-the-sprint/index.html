Welcome to your design sprint! Before we get started this week, here’s a
short list of expectations. These will help you get ready for the
sprint and hit the ground running! For more information on how
sprints work, check out our

<h2>What to Expect</h2>

<h3><strong>Consistent attendance is key</strong></h3>
Clear your schedule for the week. If you don’t think you can attend
all scheduled days, consider sending someone else. It’s better for us
to have fewer people who attend every day than more people who only
attend for part of the sprint.

<h3><strong>No laptops or phones</strong></h3>
If you need to use your devices, we ask you to step out of the room.

<h3><strong>There will be regular breaks!</strong></h3>
We want everyone to stay focused and rested, not burnt out. We can
also provide lunch on the first day, and snacks throughout the week.

<h3><strong>Only one decision maker</strong></h3>
Throughout the sprint, we'll need someone to have the final
say on some decisions. Know in advance who that person is.
If they can't participate in the sprint, choose a representative who
will speak for them and who will be there every day.

<h3><strong>Be ready to take risks</strong></h3>
Sprints let us explore many ideas and (in)validate them quickly.
Take advantage of the quick turnover.

<div class="sprint-expectations-cell">
<h3><strong>You get what you put into it</strong></h3>
Come ready to draw, share new ideas, and think outside the box.
The more you engage with the process, the better the results.
