<h2>Overview of Test</h2>
<p>
The last phase of the Product Design Sprint is to test our assumptions
and how users react to the prototype. Going into each
test you should have a plan of what you are testing and how you know if
that is successful or not. This is best achieved through an
<a href="">Assumption/Test table</a>.
</p>

<h2>Recommended Tools:</h2>
<h2>Usability Testing</h2>
<p>
This is the most used form of testing. Bring in 4â€“6 potential users and
show them the prototype that you made. Pay close attention to problems
that they have and be sure to follow a script to cover the assumptions
that you are testing. With their permission you can record these but
it's best to see them as they happen.
</p>
<p>
For remote users testing have users share their screen using Google
Hangout or Skype and record the testing using a screen recorders such as
ScreenFlow.
</p>
<h2>Survey Test</h2>
<p>
This is a good way to reach a bunch of potential users and see their
answers. Create a simple form with
<a href="http://www.google.com/forms/about/">Google Forms</a>
or <a href="https://formkeep.com/">FormKeep</a>. Post the form to
forums or other places that would have ideal users on it. Make sure the
form is easy to fill out and open ended enough to collect qualitative
information.
</p>
<h2>Fake landing page</h2>
<p>
To judge interest create a fake landing page with email collection.
This could be something as simple as a Launchrock page or a Squarespace
site or a completely custom site with a
<a href="https://formkeep.com/">FormKeep form</a> for email
collection. Run Google Analytics and see how many people sign up and
how many people visit.
