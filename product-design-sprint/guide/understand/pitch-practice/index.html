<h2>Best to use when</h2>
<p>
It's best to practice the pitch several times throughout the sprint,
typically at the beginning of each day. It makes sure that everyone is
staying in line with the original intent of the sprint encapsulated in
the Problems Statement. It also allows the Product Owner to practice
and refine the application's elevator pitch.
