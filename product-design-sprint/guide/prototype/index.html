<h2>Overview of Prototype</h2>
<p>
The core purpose of the prototype, the assumptions you are trying to
validate/invalidate or the knowledge gaps you are trying to fill should
have all been discussed in Converge. During this phase you will build a
quick and dirty prototype. Since you only have at most a day to build
the prototype it should be as low-fi as you can get away with during
Testing.
</p>
<p>
During this phase roles shift. Designers are typically the ones building
the prototype unless it is low-fi enough for everyone to contribute
(see: Keynote or Paper Prototype). Product Owners should be in charge
of getting realistic information, data and copy into the prototype. It
should be clear what everyone's role is before the phase starts. The
team should check in with each other as much as possible to make sure
everything is on the right track.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a mindset of "Yes and"</li>
<li>Constantly ask “How might we?”</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tools:</h2>
<h2>InVision (Recommended)</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/">Invision</a> is really great for
being able to take mockups from Photoshop or Sketch and allow for users
to click through to different states or pages. Invision allows for you
to create a simple image map for your users. Because it takes mockups it
allows for you to create designs that look more visually appealing or
visually complete.
</p>
<h2>HTML &amp; CSS</h2>
<p>
HTML &amp; CSS prototypes tend to be the most time consuming but are best
for heavier web interactions like filling out forms. Use
<a href="https://github.com/dice-media-group/middleman-template">Middleman Template</a>
for a starting point and quickly host on
<a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>.
</p>
<h2>Paper Prototype</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://alistapart.com/article/paperprototyping">Paper prototyping</a>
is as low-fi as you can get for a prototype. It is
especially useful when you are under a time crunch to produce a
prototype. It also allows for the whole team to contribute. Because the
prototype is sketches on paper you are relying much more on the
imagination of the participant. It gives you the ability to prototype
on the fly, even during the session with the participant. Tools like
Marvel and POP can help present sketches on a mobile device or in the
browser so that it seems more real.
