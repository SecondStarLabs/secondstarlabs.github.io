            <p>Here's the flow. Read <a href="https://tbot.io/protocol">our git protocol</a> for the git commands.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Create a local feature branch based off master.</li>
                <li>When feature is complete and tests pass, stage the changes.</li>
                <li>When you've staged the changes, commit them.</li>
                <li>Write a <a href="https://tbot.io/better-commit-message">good commit message</a>.</li>
                <li>Share your branch.</li>
                <li>Submit a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/">GitHub pull request</a>.</li>
                <li>Ask for a code review in <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>.</li>
                <li>A team member other than the author reviews the pull request. They follow
                    <a href="https://tbot.io/code-review">Code Review guidelines</a> to avoid miscommunication.</li>
                <li>They make comments and ask questions directly on lines of code in the GitHub web interface or in Slack.</li>
                <li>When satisfied, they approve or comment on the pull request that it's ready to merge.</li>
                <li>Rebase interactively. Squash commits like "Fix whitespace" into one or a small number of valuable commit(s). Edit commit messages to reveal intent.</li>
                <li>View a list of new commits. View changed files. Merge branch into master.</li>
                <li>Delete your remote feature branch.</li>
                <li>Delete your local feature branch.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Test-Driven Development moves code failure earlier in the development process. It's better to have a failing test on your development machine than in production. It also allows you to have tighter feedback cycles.</p>

            <p>Code reviews that happen right before code goes into master offer similar benefits:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>The whole team learns about new code as it is written.</li>
                <li>Mistakes are caught earlier.</li>
                <li>Coding standards are more likely to be established, discussed, and followed.</li>
                <li>Feedback from this style of code review is far more likely to be applied.</li>
                <li>No one forgets context ("Why did we write this?") since it's fresh in the author's mind.</li>
            </ul>
