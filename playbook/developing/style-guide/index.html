            <p><a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/style">We write code in a consistent style</a> that emphasizes cleanliness and team communication.</p>

            <p>High level guidelines:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Be consistent.</li>
                <li>Don't rewrite existing code to follow this guide.</li>
                <li>Don't violate a guideline without a good reason.</li>
                <li>A reason is good when you can convince a teammate.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Where we can, we set up <a href="https://houndci.com">Hound</a> to help automate following the style guide during Code Review, which helps us stick to our high-level guidelines and keep our reviews focused on code legibility &amp; quality.</p>
