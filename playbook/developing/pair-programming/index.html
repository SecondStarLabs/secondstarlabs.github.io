            <p>Code that is written by two people who sit next to each other at the same computer is <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/pair.html">pair-programmed</a> code. That code is considered high quality and should result in cost savings due to less maintenance.</p>

            <p>In the long run, this style of development saves money because fewer bugs are written and therefore do not need to be fixed later.</p>

            <p>An indication that pairing is beneficial and should be done more often is the following example:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>When you are writing an important piece of code, don't you want another person to look it over before it goes into production?</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>While we don't pair program 100% of the time, we recognize the difficulty in acting as a team when we work at a distance from each other. There is no better collaboration between designers, developers, or between designers and developers than at the keyboard.</p>
