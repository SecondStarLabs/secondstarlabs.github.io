What is User Interface Design?

<div class="playbook-content"><blockquote>
<p>An interface is a place where two things meet: the human and the computer.
The computer has functions it can perform. The human needs inputs and
outputs to take advantage of those functions. The interface is the
arrangement of inputs and outputs that enable people to apply the computer's
functions to create outcomes they want. - <a href="https://tbot.io/what-ui-really-is">Ryan Singer</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the context of our software, the user interface is the individual views
that provide for goal completion.</p>

<p>We evaluate interfaces on the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Puts outcomes first</strong></li>
<li>Provides users with affordances</li>
<li>Congruent with surrounding platform</li>
<li>Consistent across entire application</li>
</ul>

<p>We put the users goals first. No one is using our software exclusively because
of how beautiful it is. There's a reason they sought our solution out. Making
that outcome easily attainable and desirable is our highest priority.</p>

<p>We make software easy to comprehend. It's not enough to be functional, users
must know capabilities exist and be able to anticipate how the software is
going to react to their inputs. Our software should be as intuitive as
possible.</p>

<p>We remain consistent with platform guidelines. Interfaces look and feel best
when in congruence with their context, rather than being strictly branded across
all platforms. We prefer common patterns when designing.</p>

<p>We retain consistency. Usable interfaces work as expected across the entire
application.</p>
