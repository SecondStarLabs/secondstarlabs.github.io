Wireframing in HTML and CSS

<div class="playbook-content-wrapper single-column-layout">
<div class="playbook-content"><p>Designers refine sketches into HTML and CSS wireframes. HTML
and CSS wireframes are built using <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon">Bourbon</a> and <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/neat">Neat</a> in the browser so the team
can understand the core experience as fast as possible. It also allows
developers to start implementing features within the wireframes.</p>

<p>It is crucial to keep the design of the application ahead of the development.
Focus should be placed on wireframing usability, user experience, and flows.</p>

<p>We find it important to keep the design and development cycle adequately tight.
We do not wireframe one month out because as we approach certain areas of the
product, we often decide to cut or change features.</p>

<p>Those changes are an expected part of the iterative process and feedback loop
between the client, the thoughtbot team, and users. It would be wasteful to
spend time wireframing features that never get built or building features that
won't be used.</p>
