            <p>We refer to an application's visual design exclusively as its style. We use <a href="https://robots.thoughtbot.com/gestalt-principles">gestalt principles</a> to communicate and bring order to those ideas in our applications.</p>

            <p>Those fundamentals include, among others:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Alignment (often achieved with grids)</li>
                <li>Emphasis (often achieved with size, position, color)</li>
                <li>Consistency (buttons, links, headers typically look alike)</li>
                <li>Whitespace (elegant, timeless, gives eye a rest)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Successful visual designs typically don't draw attention to themselves. The content will be front-and-center. The workflows through the site will be obvious. Resist the temptation to aim for a design that is "memorable" or a design that "pops."</p>

            <p>Successful designs are usable. Consider Google's visual design:</p>

            <p><img src="/images/web/google-mail.jpg" alt="Gmail"></p>

            <p>Everything's on a grid. The "Search" and "Compose" buttons are emphasized over other calls to action with color. The unread messages are emphasized over other messages with a bold font weight.</p>

            <p><img src="/images/web/google-search.jpg" alt="Google Search"></p>

            <p>Everything's on a grid. There is lots of whitespace (especially with
                <a href="https://tbot.io/adblock">AdBlock</a>). Search interface is consistent with Gmail.</p>

            <p><img src="/images/web/google-video.jpg" alt="Google Video"></p>

            <p>Grids. Whitespace. Consistent search box, search filters, search results.</p>

            <p><img src="/images/web/google-shopping.jpg" alt="Google Shopping"></p>

            <p>Grids. Whitespace. Emphasis on searching and price information.</p>

            <p>We say "visual design" instead of "graphic design" because typically graphics aren't called for in our applications. Instead, we rely on these principles and excellent <a href="https://tbot.io/design-for-developers">typography</a>, using high-quality typefaces from <a href="http://typekit.com">Typekit</a> and
