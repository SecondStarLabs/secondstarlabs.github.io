<div class="playbook-content"><p>In order to analyze metrics later, we need to instrument our app to log the
right metrics. The primary type of instrumentation we care about is called
"event tracking."</p>

<p>Use <a href="https://segment.com/">Segment</a> to capture events whenever possible. It is
analogous to <a href="http://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/adapter">the adapter pattern</a> for analytics services.</p>

<p>Segment provides one JavaScript library in our web apps,
one library in our server-side framework,
and one SDK in our mobile apps.
This allows us to toggle different services
such as Google Analytics, Amplitude, FullStory, Intercom, and others.</p>

<p><img src="/images/segment-io.jpg" alt="Segment"></p>

<p>When Segment does not support a backend service, we can either use the
service directly or contribute to the appropriate <a href="https://segment.com/libraries/analytics.js">Segment open source
libraries</a>.</p>

<p>The hardest part of event tracking is choosing the <a href="http://qr.ae/GBPdx">granularity of the
events</a>. It's costly to reconstruct historical measurements and
missed knowledge can kill an early-stage product. So:</p>

<ul>
<li>track events as soon as they exist in the product</li>
<li>err on the side of more data than less</li>
<li>include as much state as possible per event</li>
<li>own the data from the start</li>
</ul>

<p>Some typical events we'll want to track:</p>

<ul>
<li>open app (mobile)</li>
<li>background app (mobile)</li>
<li>pageviews (web)</li>
<li>create account</li>
<li>make purchase</li>
<li>add content</li>
<li>make connection/friend</li>
<li>upgrade subscription</li>
<li>refer friend</li>
</ul>

<p>Use properties on events liberally. Typically include:</p>

<ul>
<li>session ID</li>
<li>all user properties</li>
<li>environment: operating system, app version, device hardware details,</li>
<li>current battery, wifi, cellular status</li>
<li>number of seconds into the session</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://tbot.io/whom-the-gods">Business analytics do not need to be realtime</a> and tracking
these data should not slow down the user experience. So, we background
these tasks whenever possible using whatever backgrounding system makes
sense for our platform.  Examples include <a href="https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job">Delayed Job</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/resque/resque">Resque</a>.</p>
