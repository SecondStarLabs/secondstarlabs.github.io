<div class="playbook-content"><p>Software is soft. It's always changing. Hopefully, we're always learning from
our changes.</p>

<p>A cool way to manage changes is via feature flags. Using a tool like
<a href="https://github.com/FetLife/rollout">Rollout</a>, we can "flag" certain features as only ready for parts of
our user base; i.e. just the development team, or just the founder's friends, or
10% of all users, etc.</p>

<p>That way, we can see how users respond to the feature without rolling it out to
everyone. We can pair this technique with A/B testing to compare how users
respond to different features.</p>
