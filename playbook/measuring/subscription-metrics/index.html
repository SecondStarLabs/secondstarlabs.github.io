<div class="playbook-content"><p>We work on a lot of products that have a monthly or yearly subscription
business model. There are some classic metrics we know we want to track
for these products, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)</li>
<li>Active subscriptions</li>
<li>Lifetime Value (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_lifetime_value">LTV</a>)</li>
<li>Churn per-plan, monthly and annually</li>
</ul>

<p>Since we use Stripe for payments, we've found <a href="https://www.baremetrics.io">Baremetrics</a> is the fastest and
easiest way to track these metrics.</p>

<p>If our clients want to raise money from investors, the following numbers are
generally considered investment-ready:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.forentrepreneurs.com/startup-killer/">LTV is 3x-5x greater than Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.forentrepreneurs.com/startup-killer/">10-30% month-over-month growth in MRR</a></li>
<li><a href="http://sixteenventures.com/saas-churn-rate">5-7% annual churn</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Churn is particularly critical when fundraising. <a href="http://www.forentrepreneurs.com/why-churn-is-critical-in-saas/">Small changes in churn can
drastically improve valuation</a>.</p>

<p>Calculating CAC is a manual spreadsheet exercise. It requires
adding employee overhead costs and direct marketing costs together, then
dividing by the number of new customers for that month.</p>

<p>For our own product, <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/upcase">Upcase</a>, we rely on our bookkeeper,
<a href="http://www.supportingstrategies.com/">Supporting Strategies</a> to provide us with those numbers, and make
adjustments for which vendors such as Google (AdWords), Twitter, or AdRoll fall
under the direct marketing accounting class.</p>
