            <p>Dave McClure's <a href="https://tbot.io/metrics-for-pirates">AARRR framework</a> provides a high-level overview of important metrics. We then use tactics such as event tracking to instrument those metrics.
            </p>

            <p>The AARRR framework is:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Acquisition</li>
                <li>Activation</li>
                <li>Retention</li>
                <li>Revenue</li>
                <li>Referral</li>
            </ul>

            <p>For an early stage product, we work to improve them in this order:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Activation: visitor finds the product desirable enough to try, is able to use it and get to <a href="https://tbot.io/aha-moment">aha moment</a> in shortest time possible</li>
                <li>Retention: user regularly uses product, it is doing the job they hired it for, customer is happy</li>
                <li>Revenue: user pays for product</li>
                <li>Acquisition: we know where our users come from, are able to try new channels, run tests, and kill or double-down on different channels</li>
                <li>Referral: users refer other users, the ideal acquisition channel</li>
            </ol>
