<div class="playbook-content"><p>We have used JIRA, Pivotal Tracker, Lighthouse, Basecamp, Trajectory, Unfuddle,
and other task management systems over the years. The following section details
a process using Trello but the overall process remains relatively similar across
different systems.</p>

<p>No two products are the same, so flexibility in the product development process
is important. Trello responds well to changing the structure of the process "on
the fly."</p>

<p>A Trello board is a software equivalent of a physical wall with columns of
sticky notes. In Trello terminology, the wall is called a "board." The columns
are called "lists." The sticky notes in columns are called "cards."</p>

<p>In the following image, "Current" is an example of a project board. "In Progress"
is an example of a list. "Confirm Internet Explorer support" is an example of a
card.</p>

<p>In any task management system, it's important to have a view into the product
development process like this. The <strong>Next Up</strong> list is the single prioritized
list to which the product team refers in order to know what to work on next. It
represents one week of work.</p>

<p>A card represents a story, bug fix, engineering task, or general todo.</p>

<p>Cards start out as a simple idea, 1-2 sentences long. As they are pulled through
boards, detail is added, explaining why (from a business perspective)
we're focusing on it, and maybe notes on suggested implementation (though
designers and developers may take or leave it at their discretion; it's supposed
to be helpful, not prescriptive).</p>

<p><img src="/images/live-trello_small.jpg" alt="Live Trello board"></p>

<p>Once the cards in the <strong>Next Up</strong> list have been prioritized and vetted, they
are ready for design and development. A designer or developer "puts their face
on it" by assigning it to themselves and pulling it into the <strong>In Progress</strong>
list.</p>

<p>The cards in the <strong>In Progress</strong> list are actively being designed or developed.
Etiquette is that you should never have your face on more than two cards at a
time. Work is done in a <a href="https://github.com/{{site.github}}/guides/tree/master/protocol">feature
branch</a>.</p>

<p>When a designer or developer creates a pull request for their feature branch,
they move the card to the <strong>Code Review</strong> list. Any reviewers "put their face
on it" while reviewing.</p>

<p>There is no bottleneck for merging into master: everyone can do it.</p>

<p>The cards in the <strong>Testing on Staging</strong> (or <strong>Testing on Ad Hoc</strong> build for
iPhone apps) list are deployed to staging (or distributed via <a href="https://developer.apple.com/testflight/">TestFlight</a>
for iPhone apps).</p>

<p>The card creator and a designer review it for accuracy and user experience.</p>

<p>There is no bottleneck for deploying to staging: everyone can do it.</p>

<p>The cards in the <strong>Ready for Production</strong> list include cards that have been
accepted on staging and are ready to be deployed (but not necessarily rolled
out).</p>

<p>There is no bottleneck for releasing to production: everyone can do it.</p>

<p>The cards in the <strong>Live (Week of [date])</strong> lists have been released. Each week
has its own Live list so we can follow what got released when.</p>
