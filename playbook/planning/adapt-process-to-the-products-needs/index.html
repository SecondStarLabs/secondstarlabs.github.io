<div class="playbook-content"><p>A single Trello board with a few lists as described above works well for most
early-stage teams and products. As they grow, however, more organizational tools
may be necessary. For example, we might want to first add lists to the "Current"
board such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bugs</li>
<li>Product Design</li>
<li>Engineering</li>
</ul>

<p>Later on, <a href="https://tbot.io/trello-gdocs-uservoice">those lists might be better organized as entire boards
themselves</a>. Separated as boards, it's easier to evaluate the
relative value of addressing each related thing. Separate boards also keep the
"Current" board clean and the product team focused on the week at hand.</p>

<p>Each of those boards can be organized as the team sees fit for the stage of the
product and the team's communication needs.</p>

<p>On the "Bugs" board, we've sometimes used labels to describe relative
criticality of the bug. If a bug is labeled Critical, then it is pulled
immediately into Next Up on the "Current" board. If the bug is not critical, it
stays in Bugs until the next weekly retrospective. A bug has steps to reproduce
the bug and optionally a screenshot or screencast.</p>

<p>The cards on the "Product Design" board are typically the result of sketching
user flows, usability tests, other user research, or the designer's feel for
visual design improvements.</p>

<p>The cards on the "Engineering" board are refactorings and other engineering
tasks necessary to reduce bugs or improve the user experience. "Response time"
is a primary user experience goal on every app. If an engineering task is
labeled Critical, then it is pulled immediately to Next Up. If the task is not
critical, it stays in Engineering until the next weekly retrospective.</p>
