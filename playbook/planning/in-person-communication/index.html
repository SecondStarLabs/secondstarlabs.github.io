	the years, and we work remotely every day within thoughtbot across offices.</p>

	<p>Remote consulting work is possible, but raises the degree of
	difficulty. One of the few requirements of Extreme Programming is that <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/customer.html">the
	customer is always available</a>.</p>

	<p>Ideally, that means face-to-face, on-site. We've set up our offices so that our
	clients work at the same cluster of desks as our teams. Nothing beats in-person
	communication.</p>

	<p>An ideal consulting project for us is one where a member of the client team is
	willing to work at our office Monday-Thursday for the duration of the project.
	Failing that, we want to find out during the sales process how available they
	will be on Slack, GitHub, and Trello.</p>

	<p>If it seems like they won't be available very often, we should seriously
	consider declining the project.</p>
