<div class="playbook-content"><p>Every morning, we get together as a team for 10 minutes at 10 AM.</p>

<p>We say what we did yesterday, what we're going to do today, and if anything is
blocking us. We immediately resolve blockers or help the person after standup.</p>

<p>We do this in order to:</p>

<ul>
<li>See each other face-to-face.</li>
<li>Learn what others are doing so you can help them.</li>
<li>Build accountability and trust.</li>
</ul>
