<div class="playbook-content"><p>Everything about how we design a mobile application has to be in the context
of that idea. It raises questions like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are they moving?</li>
<li>Are they relaxed on a couch?</li>
<li>How dexterous are their fingers?</li>
</ul>

<p>We try to start with the most usable platform first. If the device needs the
camera, calendar, or address book, a "native" app like an iPhone or iPad app
may be the right choice.</p>

<p>For other products, especially content-only products such as text, images,
videos, and landing pages, a mobile web app makes sense because:</p>

<ul>
<li>All modern smartphones can render HTML.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon">Bourbon</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/neat">Neat</a> make "responsive" designs easy to
implement.</li>
<li>We can create and iterate quickly.</li>
<li>We can deploy new versions multiple times a day.</li>
</ul>
