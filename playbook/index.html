<p>
We are {{site.brand}} . We look to work with hundreds of product teams all over
the world, from individual founders who are self-funded, to large
multi-national organizations. We have also created our own products and
dozens of open source libraries.
</p>
<p>
This is our playbook. It details how we make successful web and mobile
products, and also how we run our company. It's filled with things we've
learned based on our own experience and study of others' experiences.
</p>
<p>
It is a living document that everyone at {{site.brand}} can edit in a private
GitHub repo.
</p>
<p>
We've made the playbook free and licensed it as Creative Commons
Attribution-NonCommercial so you may learn from, or use, our tactics in
your own company. While our "plays" have worked for us, we trust your
judgment over ours to decide which tools and techniques might work for you,
too.

<h2>
Product Design Sprint
</h2>
<p>All our projects are design-led, starting with post-its and sketching,
ending with design implemented as code in the app. We use design sprints
and user research to understand our client's problems, validate
assumptions about the products, and build products that are user-centered.</p>

<h2>
Choose Platforms
</h2>
<p>Early in a project, we have to decide which platforms we'll use. Which
platform depends on our ideas for solving these users' problems.
After considering what's best for users, the best tools for us have a
strong community, make us happy, and help us create and iterate quickly.</p>

Developing

<p>The majority of our development practices were first detailed in Kent Beck's
classic <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321278658">Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change</a> and in Gerald
Weinberg's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0932633420">The Psychology of Computer Programming</a>.
We've tried its practices and found that using most of the practices most of the

Measuring
</h2>
<p>The difficult part of measuring is deciding what to track. Dave McClure's
<a href="https://tbot.io/metrics-for-pirates">AARRR framework</a> provides a high-level overview of important metrics.
We then use tactics such as event tracking to instrument those metrics.</p>
