			<p>The exercises in this phase force us to stop generating new solutions, converge
			on the best, and write the test for the prototype.</p>

			<p>First, we identify assumptions we're making in the best ideas. We list all
			assumptions about users' motivations, the business model, our ability to acquire
			users, and our ability to implement the solution within budget. This helps
			eliminate some options.</p>

			<p>We then look for conflicts in the remaining sticky notes, user flows, and user
			interfaces: ideas that aim to solve the same problem in different ways. We
			eliminate solutions that can't be pursued currently.</p>

			<p>We then decide whether we're creating one prototype ("best shot") or multiple
			("battle royale"). Multiple prototypes are more initial work but may reveal more
			dead ends and help us dodge more bullets without running follow-on sprints.</p>

			<p>We then storyboard each prototype. This is a comic book-style story of our
			customer moving through the critical path.</p>

			<p>Lastly, we create the testing script in Google Docs and put the scoreboard on
			the wall of the observation room. The script is based on the storyboard and the
			scoreboard will be used to record the results of the test. This helps us be very
			explicit about what we're trying to learn.</p>
