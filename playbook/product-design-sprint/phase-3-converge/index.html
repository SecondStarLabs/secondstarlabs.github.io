<div class="playbook-content"><p>The exercises in this phase force us to stop generating new solutions, converge
on the best, and write the test for the prototype.</p>

<p>First, we identify assumptions we're making in the best ideas. We list all
assumptions about users' motivations, the business model, our ability to acquire
users, and our ability to implement the solution within budget. This helps
eliminate some options.</p>

<p>We then look for conflicts in the remaining sticky notes, user flows, and user
interfaces: ideas that aim to solve the same problem in different ways. We
eliminate solutions that can't be pursued currently.</p>

<p>We then decide whether we're creating one prototype ("best shot") or multiple
("battle royale"). Multiple prototypes are more initial work but may reveal more
dead ends and help us dodge more bullets without running follow-on sprints.</p>

<p>We then storyboard each prototype. This is a comic book-style story of our
customer moving through the critical path.</p>

<p>Lastly, we create the testing script in Google Docs and put the scoreboard on
the wall of the observation room. The script is based on the storyboard and the
scoreboard will be used to record the results of the test. This helps us be very
explicit about what we're trying to learn.</p>
