<div class="playbook-content"><p>We want to ensure that our user's data is encrypted during transit and that the
data they may provide is sent securely. <a href="https://https.cio.gov/everything/">The HTTPS-Only Standard</a> provides a
great, and much more detailed, description of the reasoning behind this.</p>

<p>This has become much easier with <a href="https://letsencrypt.org">Let's Encrypt</a>, which provides a free to use,
automatic and secure certificate authority. It's integrated with Heroku, which
allows us to use their <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/automated-certificate-management">Automated Certificate Management</a> feature.</p>

<p>When we need wildcard certificates (e.g.: when we want to use the same
certificate across <code>www.</code>, <code>staging.</code>, etc.), or those with advanced features,
we use <a href="https://dnsimple.com/ssl-certificate">DNSimple</a>.</p>
