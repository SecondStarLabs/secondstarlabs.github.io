Programming secure web and mobile apps

<p class="paragraph-primary">
We use mature web application frameworks such as
<a href="/services/ruby-on-rails">Ruby on Rails</a>
and
<a href="/services/elixir-phoenix">Elixir Phoenix</a>
that contain defaults to help avoid common vulnerabilities
involving code injection, session hijacking, and cross-site scripting.

Cloud security and compliance

We deploy to
<a href="https://www.heroku.com/policy/security">Heroku</a>
, which is built atop
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/security/">Amazon Web Services</a>.
Heroku and Amazon manage their platform updates for network security,
vulnerability testing, and anti-virus checks.
They keep their platforms compliant with the ISO 27001 standard and
maintain IT governance certifications such as FedRAMP and SOC 2.

Open source software and cloud platforms are a head start

We know there are many questions when planning a secure app:
Rewrite the current codebase or refactor it?
Which programming language and framework?
How do we penetration test our application?
</p>
<p class="paragraph-primary">
We've been developing software for 13 years for 700+ clients and
would love to share our experience.
Let's talk about how we can help!
