                All the expertise you need to write clean, well-tested Android applications.

            </h2>
            <p>There are well over 2 million Android apps. If your app is going to make an impact, it’s going to have to be something very special. Your developers need to be pretty special too. You're not only going to need just outstanding expertise and creativity, but also serious strategic direction combining robust code, slick design and superb user experience.
            </p>
            <p>Aside from the level of experience and expertise that Dice Media Group's Android app development team offers, there another big difference between our approach and that of most other app devs around the world. It's a marriage of design and seamless integration, in the front and back end.

        <h2>Integrated: Android design, development, and back end all in one place
        </h2>
        <p>The design and development process for most apps can be a disjointed and discordant process. It usually begins with an individual or a small team designing the app. They will then pass off their work to another team to handle the functional front end development. And in entirely separate silo there is a third team, working on the back end - where all the data lives - who rarely see any designs or front end details at all. Most of the time, this arrangement works well enough, but rarely does it produce something great.
            <br>
            <br> At thoughtbot, the end product is never just an app that works. It's an app that works beautifully, one that users love to use. Our Android design experts are not just designers — they understand the Android ecosystem from front to back. Design, front end, and back end are developed together for the slickest end product.

        <!-- <h2>Local app developers, global expertise</h2>
<p> thoughtbot has local Android developers in Boston, San Francisco, Austin, New York, and London. That means you can sit down with the people who are going to build and design your app, in person. Because we use a small number of world-class app developers rather than large numbers of production-line devs working on a single component, the teams are small enough that everyone involved in the project will know your market, your dreams, and the hurdles that need to be navigated. </p><p> The local development teams can also draw on the expertise of other thoughtbot offices around the world, both in the US and Europe, so if there is a rare skillset your app needs to really shine, we can lean on an expert consultant from another location </p>
